### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
json web token

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
The signature is a cryptographic value generated by applying a specific algorithm and a secret key to the header and payload. Its main job is to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the JWT.

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
yes anyone can see whats inside if they have access to the jwt

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
When a user logs in or authenticates, their credentials are verified by an authentication service which generates a JWT as a token of authentication. The token contains information that represent the user's identity and other relevant information, such as user roles or permissions. The JWT is signed using a secret key or a private key known only to the authentication service. This signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the JWT. The JWT is then returned to the client as part of the authentication response.The user receives the JWT and typically stores it securely. This can be done in various ways, such as storing it in a cookie, local storage, or a secure memory store, depending on the application's architecture and security considerations. Any additional requests are made with the token in tow.


- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
 unit tests are narrow in scope, isolated, and focus on individual code units. Integration tests examine interactions between components or services. End-to-end tests assess the entire system's functionality from a user's perspective. The choice of which type of test to use depends on the testing objectives, the specific part of the system being evaluated, and the trade-offs between coverage and test execution speed. 

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
 a mock is a simulated object or component that mimics the behavior of a real object or component. Mocks are used in testing to isolate the code under test and control its environment. Some things you can mock include: Time and date, databases, or network requests.

- What is continuous integration?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves regularly integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. The main goal of CI is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process, promoting collaboration, and ensuring that the software remains in a consistently functional state.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the behavior of running processes or applications on a computer. These variables are part of the environment in which a process runs and can be accessed by software during runtime. Environment variables are typically key-value pairs, where the key is the variable name, and the value is the associated data.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
test driven development is the practice of writing your tests first and then constructing the rest of your program around those tests. It is a valuable practice that can improve code quality, reduce bugs, and provide confidence in the software's correctness. However, its effectiveness depends on the team's understanding and commitment to the process. TDD also has a steep learning curve for those new to the approach


- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
JSON Schema provides a standardized and powerful approach to validating the structure and content of JSON documents. It adds clarity to data expectations, promotes interoperability, and enhances the overall quality and security of JSON-based systems. 

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
A couple different ways to decide which code to test are: By importance, Which pieces of code are most central to the functioning of the software. Code that breaks often or easily. Code that you change often or code that is used a lot.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
 It will return a result set that contains values of columns after the execution of the statement.You use it when you need to verify data, whant to obtain some generated value(s), or to chain different sql operations together.
- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
 while HTTP is well-suited for traditional request-response communication in web applications, Web Sockets provide a more efficient and flexible solution for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
  I prefer Flask it felt more intuitive for me and the tools were more comprehensive. While express seems to offer more flexibility in certain respects flask aligns more with the process i follow when i code.
